# Hister

**Web history on steroids**

Hister is a web history management tool that provides blazing fast, content-based search for visited websites. Unlike traditional browser history that only searches URLs and titles, Hister indexes the full content of web pages you visit.

## Features

- **Privacy-focused**: Keep your browsing history indexed locally - don't use remote search engines if it isn't necessary
- **Full-text indexing**: Search through the actual content of web pages you've visited
- **Advanced search capabilities**: Utilize a powerful [query language](https://blevesearch.com/docs/Query-String-Query/) for precise results
- **Efficient retrieval**: Use keyword aliases to quickly find content
- **Flexible content management**: Configure blacklist and priority rules for better control
